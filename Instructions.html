        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Selection (Home)</h3>
        <p>The Selection Home allows you to roll attacks and damage for monsters. The order of the monsters
            is the same as the D&D 5e Monster Manual (missing a few as it is the SRD list), or almost exactly the same
            as <a href="https://open5e.com/monsters/monster-list">the Open5e Monsters list</a>.</p>
        <p>Once you have selected all the attacks you would like to do as well as the 'use monster' button
            found in each monster's menu if you are using at least one monster of that kind. As well as the 'Send
            Monster x to Battle' if you are
            using monster x in that Monster's menu, press the green 'Send Creature/s to Battle!' button at the bottom of
            the screen. </p>
        <p>This should take you to the results page.</p>
        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>To close a Letter's or Monster's menu press the Letter's or Monster's button that you pressed to open
                it.</li>
            <li>If you will be using a creature for several rounds and it will be doing different attacks in these
                rounds,
                select all the attacks you may want to use in the next several rounds and only use the ones that apply
                each round (see the results instructions
                for more information on this).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Results:</h3>
        <p> The results should turn up if they don't the most common reason is that eg. for a Balor, the 'Use Balor'
            button
            on the previous page has not been selected.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To repeat the current round of attacks click refresh and if the browser asks you whether you would like
                to resend form click yes.</li>
            <li>To edit the current round of attacks click the back button taking you to the selection page where the
                attacks used in the previous round should be selected.</li>
            <li>To reset all attacks click the back button to get to the selection page and refresh.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Selection Advanced</b></p>
        <p> The biggest difference is that the advanced selection rolls for advantage/disadvantage.</p>
        <p> It does this by rolling a second attack roll for each attack selected (as well as sometimes
            having to re-roll damage, eg. if you get a critical hit on the second roll and have advantage). The reason
            why I have
            not just replaced the main roller with this is because it could be quite confusing for new users.</p>
