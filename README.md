Ross Taylor's DM Combat Compactifier, continued.

Ross wrote this in PHP, with quite a lot of manual coding and repetition.
We're planning to move the code entirely into Javascript, which
* makes it browser-resident,
* doesn't require any infrastructure on the host server (Ozzard is a security nut), and
* means the files can be cached by proxies so users get the files faster and we don't have to pay for traffic (Ozzard is also part Lancashire, part Yorkshire, part Scottish, and all skinflint).

We wouldn't recommend forking this repo right now, as there's a lot of quick work we want to do on it to get it into the new form and hence a very high chance that you'll be left with an orphan.
