      <li>Designer of original PHP website and originator of data: Penguinator64</li>
      <li>Data conversion and pure Javascript application: <a href="https://www.ozzard.org">Ozzard</a>.</li>

    <p>This project would not have been feasible without a plethora of technologies: the Internet, IP, TCP, HTTP, web browsers, Javascript, react, react-select, i18next, Bootstrap, reactstrap, Bootswatch, and many we've omitted.
      Thank you to all the developers, users, and standardisers of those many technologies. When your party kills that hill giant you're managing using DM Combat Compactifier, remember that we're all standing on the shoulders of giants.</p>
